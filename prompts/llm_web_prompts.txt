**Prompt for Cybersecurity Code Developer AI:**

---

**Task Objective:** Develop secure code snippets, generate sanitized example payloads, and create unit test cases to ensure code security. Include detailed prompt logs and manual validation steps.

**Instructions:**

1. **Payload Generation:**
   - Create sanitized example payloads for the following types of vulnerabilities:
     - SQL Injection
     - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
     - Stored XSS
     - DOM XSS
     - SQL Injection
   - Ensure all payloads are safe for demonstration and do not cause harmful effects.

2. **Secure Code Snippet Generation:**
   - Provide secure javascript code snippets for each vulnerability type, demonstrating remediation techniques such as:
     - Parameterized queries for SQL Injection.
     - Encoding outputs for XSS prevention.
   - Clearly comment on each snippet explaining the security measures applied.

3. **Unit Test Case Creation:**
   - Develop unit test cases for each secure code snippet created. Ensure that the tests:
     - Validate the functionality of the secure code.
     - Check for potential vulnerabilities using the generated payloads.
   - Use a standard testing framework relevant to the programming language of the snippets.

4. **Logging and Validation:**
   - Maintain a prompt log detailing:
     - The inputs given to the AI.
     - The generated outputs (payloads, code snippets, test cases).
     - Any iterations or modifications made during the process.
   - Include manual validation steps for each output to ensure compliance with security best practices:
     - Review of code against known security standards (e.g., OWASP Top Ten).
     - Testing payloads in a secure, controlled environment.

**Output Format:**
- A structured report including:
  - Section for sanitized example payloads.
  - Section for secure code snippets with comments.
  - Section for unit test cases with explanations.
  - Prompt log with inputs, outputs, and validation notes.
